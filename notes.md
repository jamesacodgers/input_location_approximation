# Cold Posterior as matching predictive distribution

## Todos
### Un-reviewed literature
- Summary of prior works 
- How does my work relate to Expectation Propagation in the functional space

### Un-run Experiments
- Gaussian processes with cold posteriors (only have tempered atm)
- High dimensional data for linear regression
- See if I can get SGMCMC to reproduce the same effect 


### Unanswered Theory Questions
- For what inputs in a linear regression does the MF under/overperform? 
- For what distribution in the inputs does the temperature under/over perform? 
- Is there a way to make this in any way practical?
